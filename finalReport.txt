Group Portion:
Our project was to create a database for the Dai Li (the secret service of Ba Sing Se from the show Avatar: the Last Airbender)
to contain and search through all of their data on various notable entities in the AtLA universe, both friendly and hostile.
Our goal was to create an easy to use, intuitive interface as well as a robust, normalized database in MariaDB as the underlying 
backbone of our data. We used 3 tables, one for entities as the "main" table, the other two table both reference the main one. 
The main table is `entities`, with a an int primary key and information about that entity, another table is aliases with a subjectID 
that is a foriegn key referencing `entities` and an alias for that entity, the last table is relationships which has essentially a 
subject verb and object representing how the subject relates to the object and both subject and object are foriegn key constraints 
referencing `entities`.

We met all of goals layed the project structure, although we originally planned to use MongoDB and then switched to MariaDB after 
some technical struggles. Our search function could be improved as well. It also would be good to add more data as the Dai Li are very 
well informed in general. If we were to continue working on this project we would add login functionality, the ability to edit entries 
in the database, skip empty fields when describing an entity, better checking and handling. A major thing would be refactoring to make 
dramatically fewer calls to the server. 

Overall this was a good experience in designing and implementing a usable product with realistic design requirements. We are 
generally proud of our accomplishments in a relatively short time period.
