What we are doing: A compilation of files on various people and organizations in the Avatar world, as written by the Dai Li.
      (Circa book 2, probably) This will be done in MongoDB.
      
People will have:
-	Known allies (organizations and people)
-	Known enemies (organizations and people)
-	Known abilities
-	Last known whereabouts
-	Brief description of the person’s personality (if known) and appearance
-	Brief history of the person
Organizations will have:
-	Known Allies (organizations and people)
-	Known enemies (organizations and people)
-	Known subordinates/members (people)
-	Brief history of organization’s goals and movements
-	Speculation on possible future moves

Names of allies and enemies will (hopefully) link to the files on them. There will be a search option for looking up by name. 
If time allows, add login functionality (maybe even admin priviliges?)
