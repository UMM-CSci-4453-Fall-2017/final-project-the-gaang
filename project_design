What we are doing: A compilation of files on various people and organizations in the Avatar world, as written by the Dai Li.
      (Circa book 2, probably) This will be done in mysql.
      
People and organizations will have:
-	a unique ID
-	Known abilities
-	Last known whereabouts
-	Brief description of the personâ€™s personality (if known) and appearance
-	Brief history of the person
-	Known allies, enemies, employers, and other relationships
-	Known aliases

Names of allies and enemies will (hopefully) link to the files on them. There will be a search option for looking up by name. 
If time allows, add login functionality (maybe even admin priviliges?)
